  abstract = 	 {We propose machine learning inspired methods for computing numerical Calabi-Yau (Ricci flat Ka ̈hler) metrics, and implement them using Tensorflow/Keras. We compare them with previous work, and find that they are far more accurate for manifolds with little or no symmetry. We also discuss issues such as overparameterization and choice of optimization methods. }
